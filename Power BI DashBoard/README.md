## Introduction:
Telco receives a lot of customers who subscribe to their service to get access to the fastest possible communication access through mobile and internet services. There are diverse set of applications which Telco gives to their users such as mobile services and communication tools to name a few.

One of the challenges that the company faces is to get to know beforehand whether a customer who has activated a service under Telco is going to leave or stay in the service (churn). If they know that a customer is going to leave the service based on a set of factors such as Gender and whether they are Senior citizen or not, they can come up with affordable plans or give promotional offers so that they retain the customer without them having to move to options from other companies.
## Problem Statement 

__Telephone__ company, also known as __telco__, is a telecommunications provider that provides services such as __telephony__ and __data communications access__. They are responsible for providing phone services to people in different parts of __The United States of America__. What makes things interesting is that there are a lot of customers who use communication services from Telco. There are customers who also opt for other services such as __television__ and __movie streaming__. The telco is at present not able to accurately predict whether a given customer who subscribes to the service is willing to churn (leave the service) or not. If they could know with good accuracy, they would be able to come up with plans and services for those users who are willing to leave the service respectively.
